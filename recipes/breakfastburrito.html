        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This breakfast burrito is the greatest thing I have ever made. I have eaten it multiple days in a row. It is relatively easy to make, and you can switch it up depending on what you like. I like mine with some heat, so if you would rather have a tamer burrito, just take the spice out.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two or Three Eggs</li>
            <li>One Jalapeno</li>
            <li>Chihuahua Cheese</li>
            <li>Large burrito tortilla</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Guacamole</li>
            <li>At least two strips bacon</li>
            <li>Sriracha hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook up the bacon strips in a pan, cut up jalapeno into small pieces while cooking</li>
            <li>After bacon is cooked, cut into small bits</li>
            <li>Prepare eggs by beating them in a bowl, after thoroughly beating them, butter the pan and then add the eggs to the heat</li>
            <li>Cook eggs to desired level, remove from heat</li>
            <li>Assemble burrito. Put the eggs on the center, top with chihuahua cheese, crumbled bacon bits, jalapeno bits, guacamole, and sriracha</li>
            <li>Roll burrito, can optionally put the rolled burrito back on pan to brown/crisp the tortilla</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
