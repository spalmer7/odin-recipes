        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These soft scrambled eggs are incredibly fast, simple, and delicious. Feel free to add some of your favorite hot sauce when eating!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two to four eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Your favorite hot sauce (or ketchup!)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a medium-sized non-stick skillet over medium-low heat, cover the whole pan</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs, when the butter is just barely bubbling, add the eggs to the pan directly in the center</li>
            <li>Watch for the edges to just barely start to set, and then gently swipe a spatula around the edges of the pan to create large soft curds</li>
            <li>Continue this until eggs start to form larger curds, do not flip the curds over, should take around 2-3 minutes</li>
            <li>When the eggs are barely set and you have some big folds of eggs, remove from heat</li>
            <li>Eat plainly, or serve on toast or a bagel, don't forget the hot sauce or ketchup</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
